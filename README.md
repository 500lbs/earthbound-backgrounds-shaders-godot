# earthbound-backgrounds-shaders-godot
This is a demo project for a Godot shader inspired by the battle backgrounds of Earthbound.
I tried to incorporate in this shader as many effects used in Earthbound to create the battle backgrounds.
You can use this project as a reference to learn how to create backgrounds using the shader.
